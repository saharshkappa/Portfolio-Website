          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi there! I am Saharsh Kappa and I am an Computer Sciecne Engineer. I started programing since i was 14, but back then it was just a subject in school. In the same year i learned about rom hacks(fan-made game mods) and i realised that one day i could potentially make my own if i continued coding. Although i never made a rom-hack, i have since grown to like programing and problem solving, and I would love to keep learning and make a small game project someday.</p>
